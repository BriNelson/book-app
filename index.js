//  As a user, I want to be able to search for books

//  get item on click from search results

// make fetch based on user input? or fetch entire database?
const searchButton = document.querySelector('#searchBtn')
const searchInput = document.querySelector('#search-input')
searchButton.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(searchInput.value)
})
fetch()

//  As a user I want to be able to add books from my search results to my list of books to read, or books I have read

//  As a user, I want to track books I have read

//  As a user, I need to be able to rate books I have read

//  As a user, I want to be able to make a list of books I want to read

//  The App must be well designed and have a well thought out user interface with a focus on the user experience. (While this ins't a design class, often times a developer will have to make these choices)
